# Transformer Model Implementation

This repository provides a comprehensive PyTorch implementation of the Transformer model, designed for sequence processing tasks like translation, summarization, and language modeling. The implementation includes all the essential components, including:

- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**
- **Transformer Blocks**
- **Encoder** (with optional Decoder for generation tasks)

## **Understanding the Transformer Model**

The Transformer model is a sequence-to-sequence architecture that leverages the self-attention mechanism to capture relationships between tokens effectively. Key components include:

- **Multi-Head Self-Attention:** Enables the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, capturing diverse contextual relationships.
- **Feed-Forward Networks:** Applies non-linear transformations to individual tokens for enhanced representational capacity.
- **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections:** Improve gradient flow and stabilize training.
- **Positional Encodings:** Add order information to tokens to account for their positions in a sequence.

## **Components Breakdown**

### **1. Multi-Head Self-Attention**

This mechanism allows the model to attend to multiple parts of the input sequence simultaneously. It calculates attention scores based on queries, keys, and values.

```python
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, heads):
        self.heads = heads
        self.embed_size = embed_size

        # Linear layers to transform inputs into queries, keys, and values
        self.values = nn.Linear(embed_size, embed_size)
        self.keys = nn.Linear(embed_size, embed_size)
        self.queries = nn.Linear(embed_size, embed_size)

        # Final output linear layer
        self.fc_out = nn.Linear(embed_size, embed_size)

    def forward(self, values, keys, queries, mask):
        # Split the embedding into self.heads chunks for multi-head attention
        # Apply the scaled dot-product attention
        ...
Explanation:

The model computes attention scores using queries, keys, and values.
Linear projections prepare the embeddings for attention computation.
Multiple attention heads allow the model to focus on different parts of the sequence simultaneously.
2. Transformer Block
The Transformer block integrates multi-head attention, feed-forward layers, residual connections, and layer normalization.

python
Copy code
class TransformerBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, heads, dropout, forward_expansion):
        self.attention = MultiHeadAttention(embed_size, heads)
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_size)
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_size)

        self.feed_forward = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(embed_size, forward_expansion * embed_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(forward_expansion * embed_size, embed_size),
        )
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, value, key, query, mask):
        # Compute attention output
        attention = self.attention(value, key, query, mask)

        # Apply layer normalization and residual connection
        x = self.norm1(attention + query)

        # Feed-forward network
        forward = self.feed_forward(x)
        out = self.norm2(forward + x)
        return out
Explanation:

Multi-Head Attention: Captures token relationships.
Feed-Forward Layer: Expands and contracts embedding size for better learning capacity.
Residual Connections: Ensure the flow of gradients through layers.
Layer Normalization: Stabilizes computations.
3. Encoder
The encoder processes the input sequence, generating contextualized embeddings for each token.

python
Copy code
class Encoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, num_layers, heads, device, forward_expansion, dropout, max_length):
        super(Encoder, self).__init__()
        self.embed_size = embed_size
        self.device = device

        # Word embedding and positional encoding
        self.word_embedding = nn.Embedding(max_length, embed_size)
        self.position_embedding = nn.Embedding(max_length, embed_size)

        # Stack of transformer blocks
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList(
            [
                TransformerBlock(
                    embed_size, heads, dropout, forward_expansion
                )
                for _ in range(num_layers)
            ]
        )

        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, x, mask):
        # Add word and positional embeddings
        seq_length = x.shape[1]
        positions = torch.arange(0, seq_length).unsqueeze(0).to(self.device)
        out = self.dropout(
            self.word_embedding(x) + self.position_embedding(positions)
        )

        # Pass through transformer blocks
        for layer in self.layers:
            out = layer(out, out, out, mask)

        return out
Explanation:

Word Embedding: Maps tokens to dense vector representations.
Positional Encoding: Adds position-specific information.
Transformer Layers: Processes sequences to generate contextual embeddings.
4. Full Transformer Model
The complete architecture integrates the encoder and optional decoder for sequence generation tasks.

python
Copy code
class Transformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, src_vocab_size, embed_size, num_layers, heads, device, forward_expansion, dropout, max_length):
        super(Transformer, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = Encoder(
            embed_size, num_layers, heads, device, forward_expansion, dropout, max_length
        )
        self.device = device

    def forward(self, src, src_mask):
        enc_src = self.encoder(src, src_mask)
        return enc_src
Explanation:

Combines all components into a single architecture.
